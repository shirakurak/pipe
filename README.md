## Why 'pipe' ?

The term 'pipe' refers to the `|>` operator used for data processing in the programming language F#. I chose to name it 'pipe' with the expectation that, like a pipeline operator, my current output would flow continuously and connect to the next output.

```fs
current output |> next output
```
