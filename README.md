# pipe

Here is my blog.

## What is written

There are various documents regarding my daily studies, events I have participated in, and slides from lightning talks. The languages used are Japanese and English.

## Why 'pipe' ?

The term 'pipe' refers to the `|>` operator used for data processing in the programming language F#. I chose to name it 'pipe' with the expectation that, like a pipeline operator, my current output would flow continuously and connect to the next output.

```fs
current output |> next output
```

## Remark

This repository is not uploaded to any static site. It is intended to be read on GitHub for simplicity (and tediousness).
