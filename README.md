## Why pipe ?

The term 'pipe' refers to the `|>` operator used for data processing in the programming language F#. I chose to name it 'pipe' with the expectation that, like a pipeline operator, my current output would flow continuously and connect to the next output.

```fs
current output |> next output
```

## Remark

This repository is not uploaded to any static site. It is intended to be read on GitHub for simplicity (and tediousness). If you want to know the latest documentation, you can check it by looking at the [commit history](https://github.com/shirakurak/pipe/commits/main).
